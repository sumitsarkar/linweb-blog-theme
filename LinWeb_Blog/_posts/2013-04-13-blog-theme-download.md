Since last day I had a strange itch to start using [Github](https://github.com). I never have used any version control system for any of my projects. All I did was update my code and replace the old code with the new one. And maybe sometimes keep an extra copy of the old code. But those copies would get lost in oblivion soon enough. This made things tough for me. 

I could not reuse any of code as often as I intended to, since I couldn't even find where I kept the damn directories. 

Maybe that's why I wanted to try out Git. The learning curve wasn't as steep. It was pretty easy to setup the core system and a git on my Linux Box. 

And for testing purposes, I've made a repository of the theme I am using in this blog. You have to make a couple of changes to use it for your own Jekyll powered blog. The <span class='word_highlight'>README.md</span> contains the information regarding the changes. 

The link to the repo is:

You are welcome to make changes and pull requests. It would be really great if you could make some cool additions. And do send me the links of your modified work. I would love to see them.
